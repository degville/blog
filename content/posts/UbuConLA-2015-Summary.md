## About UbuConLA

Last week I attended the 2015 edition of UbuConLA, a successor to what once was
UDS, the Ubuntu Developer Summit which later transformed into vUDS, the **v**
standing for virtual which eventually was renamed to *Ubuntu Online Summit*.
UbuConLA, fully organized by the community, tries to relive the days of UDS for
a chance to see face to face with fellow Ubuntu contributors or contributors to
be or just people generally interested in Ubuntu. So in other words, the social
and human aspect of it.

My first UbunConLa was in 2013 and took place in Montevido, we had recently
announced and released the Ubuntu Phone (dubbed as Ubuntu Touch) and spoke
about it then.

This year, the even took place in Lima and was organized by a very avid Ubuntu
Member, Jose Antonio Rey; he did an excellent job overall with the
organization.

For this event I took my Ubuntu powered phones and tablets to be able to
display and show around. People seemed to like them and the general comment was
*"I expected this to crash more"*.


## Walk the talk with Snappy

The thing I wanted to talk about this year wasn't specifically about phones
though, as was in 2013 when the phone was fresh, this year I talked about
**Snappy**, Ubuntu Core and to some extent Ubuntu Personal. Everyone seemed
receptive to the idea and the roadmap. I tried to go through the history
and lead the way to the logical conclusion of **why** a *snappier*
architecture was needed instead of just laying it out which seemed to
hit the nail on the right spot. I must add that the audience was a mix of
users and developers.


## Listening in

I had the pleasure to listen to some great talks here and there, all were
good to some degree but these are the ones that kept resonating after a while

### Title needed, by Juanjo Ciarlante

Led with grace and ease, when he talked, the
complicated felt simple and elegant. He rambled over the hot *cloud* topic,
going over a cube and triangle

### Juju, by .....

Was great, I liked how the presenter presented this, so far my interactions
with how juju works and is used was limiting (I had the basics, but that
was it).

### School, by

This guy came from Puno, an engineer turned school teacher for the love of the
art, he went through how he failed at teaching kids how to develop software
by jumping straight into it and instead on how he approached it with simpler
things like programming without a computer and only using your mouth and ears.
Later on diving into other things like codely and blocky and MITs Android
development kit. It seemed pretty effective as he says the acceptance and joy in his class is
pretty good.

He did not stop there, with a sprinkle of Peruvian politics and comments on
how One Laptop per Child failed miserably in Peru, he told us his anectode of
how he repurposes unopened OLPCs boxed in a closet with Ubuntu to be able to
teach kids.

My personal take on this, is if you want something like this to succeed, it
needs to be bottom up, instead of top down which he alluded to when telling the
story on how to get teachers out of their dogma and buy into change and it is
not that teachers don't like change more so that they can't cope with things
just being dropped on them (like OLPCs to schools without electricity).

### Honorary mentions


## Closing remarks

I mostly liked the whole event, the organization was great. Everything was
streamed live through ubuntuonair.com and available for offline consumption
through the [Ubuntu on Air Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/ubuntuonair).

On Saturday, we had a group photo taken outside on campus just like what was
done during the UDS's of the past.

While I'm not the best person socializing, I did have a good chance at it.
My socializing was mostly with other speakers for some odd reason though.

My only critique here is that it is hard to make this event known when the
cities are switched between the whole Latin American continent, well, it is two
fold; on the one hand it's good to spread the knowledge, on the other it
becomes harder to grow a base and dig deeper into the nitty gritty details.
