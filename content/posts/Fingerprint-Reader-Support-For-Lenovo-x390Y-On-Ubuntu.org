This is experimental, but I went ahead and ran the following after reading about it on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxOnThinkpad/comments/f9hdys/x1y4f31_just_got_the_fingerprint_sensor_to_work/][reddit]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
snap install fwupdmgr
/snap/bin/fwupdmgr install https://fwupd.org/downloads/cbe7b45a2591e9d149e00cd4bbf0ccbe5bb95da7-Synaptics-Prometheus_Config-0021.cab
/snap/bin/fwupdmgr install https://fwupd.org/downloads/3b5102b3430329a10a3636b4a594fc3dd2bfdc09-Synaptics-Prometheus-10.02.3110269.cab
#+END_SRC

Rebooted and then went ahead with the actual fingerprint setup:

After this was all done, login with fingerprints just worked. The only downside is
that you need to press a key first to bring up the unlock logic.
