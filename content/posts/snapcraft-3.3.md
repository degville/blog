snapcraft 3.1 is now available on the stable channel of the Snap Store. This is a new minor release building on top of the foundations laid out from the [snapcraft 3.3 release](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/3.3).

If you are already on the `stable` channel for snapcraft then all you need to do is wait for the snap to be refreshed.

The full [release notes](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/3.3) are replicated here below

## Core
### base: core
In order to use the new features of snapcraft, introduced with 3.0, and still use 16.04 as a base, support for use of `base: core` has been added. This will trigger the same semantics as using the `base` keyword in snapcraft.

### Alternate directory for snapcraft.yaml
`build-aux/snap` is now supported as an alternative directory for snapcraft.yaml and its assets (i.e.; hooks, gui, ...). To avoid confusions, snapcraft now display what directory it is picking for assets depending on where the snapcraft.yaml is found. It will only pick `build-aux/snap` for assets if the `snapcraft.yaml` is found in that path.

### string validations
Snapcraft now produces a better error for when the type detected for the version _string_ is not a _string_.

## Plugins
### python
A minor fix which should bring _rebuilding_ capabilities to projects using the **python** plugin.
Long gone should be the days of seeing messages of the following construct:
```
You must give at least one requirement to install (maybe you meant "pip install â€¦")
```

### python and go
Expanded schema errors for users of the **go** and **python**, allowing for early discovery of non-valid uses of these plugins. Most importantly, this eliminates the cryptic error during build time when not using a combination of the `source` and `<plugin-name>-packages` keywords.

### nodejs
Entries of type _string_ are now supported in `package.json` for the `bin` keyword (previously, the plugin could only parse dictionary entries), this means that constructs from `package.json` of the form:
```json
{
  "name": "unnamed",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Using string bin entries.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "bin": "bin/index.js",
}
```
should be parse and interpreted correctly by snapcraft.

## Store
### Register against a specific store
Brand stores are a commercial feature of the Snap Store.

The following syntax is now allowed as part of the `register` command:
```
snapcraft register [--store <store>] <snap-name>
```
Which will allow users to register snaps for specific brand stores.
