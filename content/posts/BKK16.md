title: Linaro Connect BKK16
---

Just a week ago I made my way back from Linaro Connect. It is my first time at
a Linaro Connect that was not jointly done with a UDS and even then I did not
participate in the event. It was also my first time in Thailand and to a
greater extent Asia so I was very interested in going.

The main purpose for attending was to show snappy and in particular, snapcraft.
The part of snapcraft that I was going to show was related to building kernels,
I must say I am quite pleased with the results.

My first two days at the event mostly involved attending the keynote
and then going to the quiet *not so quiet* hacking room and work on
supporting whatever my colleagues Ricardo and Alexander wanted to demo and
present in their accepted talk.

In one of those two keynotes or in another random presentation I attended, I
discovered (personally, others may have known already) that 96boards had
released a working 4.4 kernel to support the 96boards initiative so those two
days I spent polishing the **kernel** snapcraft plugin we had to be able
to build a nice *kernel snap* for Ubuntu Core using the 96boards kernel, that
was a success and part of what is being released today with snapcraft (a follow
up post will describe how to make use of this plugin).

On day three, jetlag really kicked in so I zombie participated with some
comments when relevant in some of the business and/or planning meetings that
went on related to Canonical, this was really fun, during introductions it
seems it was a nice ice breaker (even though not my intention) to say *I'm just
an engineer working on ...*. I felt I had to put emphasis on mentioning *just*
after all other folk exchanged business cards (note to self: maybe get some
business cards) and mentioned all these fancy titles :-)

On day four the main highlight from an Ubuntu point of view, was Alexander and
Ricardo's [presentation](http://connect.linaro.org/resource/bkk16/bkk16-406/).

I also briefly met some of the fine Qualcomm folk and it turns out they are
running a [maker's contest](https://dragonboardcontest.com/)

The last day was demo day mostly, so Ricardo and me setup a couple of
snappy related demo's, there was lot of interest across which left us
pleased.

There was time to socialize as well and I did get to see some former Canonical
faces and catch up a bit; there was also some spare time to get to know new
people and that is always fun as well.

Given that I've never been to Bangkok before, the Saturday that followed was
dedicated to some sightseeing.
